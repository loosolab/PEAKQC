# PEAKQC

Periodicity Evaluation As Key aspect of ATAC-seq Quality Control

A python tool for ATAC-seq quality control in single cells. 
On the bulk level quality control approaches rely on four key aspects: \n
    1. signal-to-noise ratio \n
    2. library complexity \n
    3. mitochondrial DNA nuclear DNA ratio \n 
    4. fragment length distribution \n
\n
Hereby relies PEAKQC on the evaluation of the fragment length distribution.
While on the bulk level the evaluation is done visually, it is not possible to do that on the single cell level.
PEAKQC solves this constraint with an convolution based algorithmic approach.
